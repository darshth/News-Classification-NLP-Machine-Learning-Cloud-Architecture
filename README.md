## Introduction


‘Data’ has taken world by storm. Humans generate massive amounts of data everyday- knowingly and unknowingly. This is what the Scientists term as ‘The Data Glut’. Pulling out some facts and figures:

•	1.7MB of data is created every second by every person during 2020.
•	In the last two years alone, we managed to create 90% of the data that exists today.
•	2.5 quintillion bytes of data are produced by humans every day. 
•	95 million photos and videos are shared every day on Instagram.
•	Every day, 306.4 billion emails are sent, and 5 million Tweets are made.
•	It is predicted that 44 zettabytes of data will make up the entire digital universe, by 2020.
•	And a mammoth 463 exabytes of data will be generated each day by humans as of 2025.

What is happening due to this is that tremendous amount of important data and information is either being lost or being fabricated. The fabrication of information leads to mass-panic, superficial believes and biased judgements. And this information is mostly fabricated in the form of news. This is what we call fake news. 

The motivation behind developing and completing this project was to efficiently deliver a one stop solution to classify news and also to efficiently tackle fake news using the best tools and technologies in Natural Language Processing and Classification. 

## Supervised Learning Approach


Both, The News Classification as well as The Fake News Detection model use Supervised Learning Approach. 

Supervised learning is a machine learning domain that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

The architecture of Supervised Learning is as given below:

Both the models use labelled data to train the machine to make accurate predictions/classifications when new instances of data are passed to the model.
